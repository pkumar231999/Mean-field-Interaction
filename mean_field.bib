   abstract = {<p>The self-consistent quantum-electrostatic (also known as Poisson-Schrödinger) problem is notoriously difficult in situations where the density of states varies rapidly with energy. At low temperatures, these fluctuations make the problem highly non-linear which renders iterative schemes deeply unstable. We present a stable algorithm that provides a solution to this problem with controlled accuracy. The technique is intrinsically convergent even in highly non-linear regimes. We illustrate our approach with both a calculation of the compressible and incompressible stripes in the integer quantum Hall regime as well as a calculation of the differential conductance of a quantum point contact geometry. Our technique provides a viable route for the predictive modeling of the transport properties of quantum nanoelectronics devices.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Quantum dynamics is very sensitive to dimensionality. While two-dimensional electronic systems form Fermi liquids, one-dimensional systems—Tomonaga–Luttinger liquids—are described by purely bosonic excitations, even though they are initially made of fermions. With the advent of coherent single-electron sources, the quantum dynamics of such a liquid is now accessible at the single-electron level. Here, we report on time-of-flight measurements of ultrashort few-electron charge pulses injected into a quasi one-dimensional quantum conductor. By changing the confinement potential we can tune the system from the one-dimensional Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid limit to the multi-channel Fermi liquid and show that the plasmon velocity can be varied over almost an order of magnitude. These results are in quantitative agreement with a parameter-free theory and demonstrate a powerful probe for directly investigating real-time dynamics of fractionalisation phenomena in low-dimensional conductors.</p>},

It aims to be a user-friendly, universal, and high-performance toolbox for the simulation of physical systems of any dimensionality and geometry that can be described by a tight-binding model. Kwant has been designed such that the natural concepts of the theory of quantum transport (lattices, symmetries, electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole degrees of freedom) are exposed in a simple and transparent way. Defining a new simulation setup is very similar to describing the corresponding mathematical model. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Greenʼs functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily thanks to its extensible and modular nature.
